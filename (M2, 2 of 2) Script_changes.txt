#Check Disk Usage of the Free_Space_Content file. This file displays the size of the NEW/ directory.

#Create a backup of the Free_Space_Content_OLD.txt file in the BACKUP/ directory. Change the end of the file's name

#Copy all contents from NEW/ into BACKUP/ without copying the NEW/ directory itself. Note the "." in the command
cp -R NEW/. BACKUP/

#Clear the NEW/ directory
rm -r NEW/*

#As an addition to the original assignment tasks I appended the use of tar, the tape or disk archive tool.
#This creates a compressed backup of the entire /home/Backup/ directory, labeled by date, and writes it to
#the /home/Backup/backups/ directory.

#First, assign the path to the DEST_FILE variable. Include the naming convention using the date.
DEST_FILE="/home/Backup/backups/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"

#Call the tar command. Create the archive (-c), use an archive file (-f) and  compress it (-z). The -C option 
tar -czf $DEST_FILE -C / home/Backup
