These are the steps I took to create and secure a user and space in the file system for an authorized "Backup" user
to conduct and edit his or her tasks. 

as root:
useradd Backup
passwd Backup #ThisIsTheBackupPassphrase
addgroup Backup
mkdir /home/Backup/daily_scripts/
mkdir /home/Backup/backups/
vim /home/Backup/daily_scripts/Compressed_Daily.sh
cp /home/codio/workspace/Kyle_Leonard.BASH /home/Backup/daily_scripts/FSBackup_Daily.sh
chown -R Backup /home/Backup/
chgrp -R Backup /home/Backup/
chmod 750 -R /home/Backup/
